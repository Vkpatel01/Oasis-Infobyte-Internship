# Oasis-Infobyte-Internship
This repository is including the Java Development solution, given by the Oasis Infobyte. My first Internship.

This Repository contains two files one is of Online Examination having some functionalities like Login credentials, Timer, Updating User Login credentials, and Selecting correct mcqs options of the asked questions.
And the other file is a Number Guessing Game, it is a fun game one can enjoy playing in leisure time. You have to guess the correct number which is randomly generated.
This is totally done by me. (Vishal Kumar Patel)
I would like the thanks Oasis Infobyte who has given me such a wonderful task to do, I have learned a lot while doing these codes.
